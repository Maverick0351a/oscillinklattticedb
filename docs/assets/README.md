Place the project logo here as `oscillink-logo.png` (recommended size ~1024px square).
This folder is used for images referenced in the main README and other docs.

Suggested export hints:
- Transparent background preferred (PNG)
- Keep the visual weight centered so it crops well at smaller sizes
- If you also export an SVG, save it as `oscillink-logo.svg` in the same folder and we can switch the README to reference it for crisper scaling
