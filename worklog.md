### Step 1: Initialize environment
- Created the `.venv` virtual environment, configured it with VS Code tooling, and installed the API package in editable mode with dev extras plus `ruff`.
- Result: Local Python toolchain ready for linting and tests.

### Step 2: Baseline checks
- Ran `ruff check api` to capture existing lint violations (multiple import formatting issues, unused imports, single-line `if` statements).
- Attempted `python -m pytest`; addressed missing dev dependencies by reinstalling `./api[dev]` and auxiliary packages (`pytest`, `httpx`, `requests`).
- Result: Established a clean baseline with recorded lint backlog and verified dependency setup.

### Step 3: Lint remediations
- Split multi-import lines, removed unused imports, and expanded single-line guards across API modules and scripts per Ruff feedback.
- Re-ran `ruff check api`; lint now passes with no findings.
- Result: Codebase conforms to Ruff's default style and import rules.

### Step 4: Test verification
- Executed `python -m pytest` from the `api/` directory (PowerShell `cd api; ..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest`).
- Result: Test suite reports `2 passed`, confirming no regressions after lint fixes.

### Step 5: Plan next iteration
- Pending follow-up: outline additional enhancements and questions for future iterations once guidance is available.
- Result: Ready to continue iterating after capturing outstanding planning action.
